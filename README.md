  ### SoC Workflow Summary

  - Chip modelling begins with specs in C and a testbench written in C.
  - A soft copy of the hardware is created using RTL (Verilog) for SoC design flow.
  - The SoC consists of processor cores and peripherals/IPs subdivided for modular design.
  - Components undergo gate-level netlist synthesis, macro synthesis, and analog IP functional modeling.
  - SoC integration assembles all blocks, including GPIOs, floorplanning, placement, clock tree synthesis, and routing for physical design.
  - Physical design leads to GDSII layout, followed by design rule checks (DRC/LVS).
  - Final SoC verification ensures all design stages are functionally equivalent (O1 = O2 = O3 = O4).
  - Resulting SoCs run at target frequencies (typically 100â€“130 MHz) and are applied in products like smartwatches, Arduino boards, TV panels, and AC applications.
  - Testbenches remain in C language throughout verification for consistency and speed.
